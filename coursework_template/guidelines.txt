There are two files in the root folder (main.py and my_database.db)

You should create all your tables in the make_database.py files, and your python logic codes in the main.py file.

After creating a new table in the make_database.py file, you must first run the make_database.py file with 
the command python3 make_database.py before exporting and running the main.py file

There are also two folders called static and templates. All static files (such as CSS and Javascripts) should be kept in the static folder. 
However, the HTML files or template files sgould be put in the templates
