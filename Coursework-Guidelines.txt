Here, I have explained how use this section of the (5009CEM-coursework) for your coursework. 

The section contains the coursework_template and the Shopping-Cart project. I have provided the Shopping-Cart cproject 

here, as most of the code logic are also relevant to the two coursework projects. However, the way it is
 
 adapted is dependent on the features of your assigned project (i.e. e-commerce or stock inventory).

please follow the instruction in this guide in to use the coursework_template

There are two files in the root folder (main.py and my_database.db)

You should create all your tables in the make_database.py files, and your python logic codes in the main.py file.

After creating a new table in the make_database.py file, you must first run the make_database.py file with 

the command python3 make_database.py before exporting and running the main.py file

There are also two folders called static and templates. All static files (such as CSS and Javascripts) should be kept in the static folder. 

However, the HTML files or template files sgould be put in the templates
